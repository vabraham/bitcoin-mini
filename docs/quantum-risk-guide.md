# Quantum Risk Mitigation Guide

Bitcoin Mini analyzes your addresses for quantum computing vulnerabilities. This guide explains what each risk level means and what actions you should take to protect your Bitcoin.

## Risk Levels Explained

### üî¥ **High Risk** - Immediate Action Required
**What it means:** Your address contains UTXOs (unspent outputs) that are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks.

**Detected patterns:**
- P2PK (Pay-to-Public-Key) outputs where the public key is exposed
- Early Taproot implementations with potential vulnerabilities

**Immediate actions:**
1. **üö® Move funds NOW** - Transfer all Bitcoin to a new, secure address
2. **Use SegWit addresses** - Generate bc1q... addresses (P2WPKH/P2WSH)
3. **Never reuse this address** - Retire it permanently
4. **Check your wallet settings** - Ensure it generates modern address types

### üü° **Elevated Risk** - Take Precautions
**What it means:** Your address has been reused (you've spent from it before), which exposes the public key.

**Why it's risky:**
- Each transaction reveals more information about your public key
- Quantum computers could potentially derive private keys from public keys
- Address reuse reduces privacy and security

**Recommended actions:**
1. **Consider moving funds** to a fresh address (not urgent but recommended)
2. **Stop using this address** for new transactions
3. **Generate fresh addresses** for each new transaction
4. **Monitor for changes** - Risk may increase with more transactions

### üü¢ **Low Risk** - Continue with Best Practices
**What it means:** No immediate quantum vulnerabilities detected.

**Why it's low risk:**
- No exposed public keys found
- Uses modern cryptographic patterns
- No evidence of address reuse

**Best practices:**
1. **Continue normal usage** but don't become complacent
2. **Still avoid reusing** this address when possible
3. **Monitor risk status** - Check periodically for changes
4. **Follow general security guidelines** below

### ‚ùì **Unknown** / ‚ùå **Error**
**Unknown:** No UTXOs found or address not yet used
**Error:** Unable to analyze due to API issues

**What to do:**
1. Try refreshing the analysis (click üîÑ button)
2. For new addresses, this is normal until first use
3. For used addresses, check your internet connection

## General Security Best Practices

### Address Type Recommendations

**‚úÖ Recommended: SegWit Addresses (bc1q...)**
- Better quantum resistance
- Lower transaction fees
- More private and secure
- Future-proof design

**‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable: P2SH Addresses (3...)**
- Decent security for now
- Consider upgrading to SegWit eventually
- Avoid for large amounts

**‚ùå Avoid: Legacy Addresses (1...)**
- Older, less secure format
- Higher fees
- No quantum resistance improvements
- Migrate to SegWit when possible

### Transaction Best Practices

1. **Never Reuse Addresses**
   - Generate a fresh address for each transaction
   - This applies to both receiving AND change outputs
   - Most modern wallets do this automatically

2. **Use HD Wallets**
   - Hierarchical Deterministic wallets generate new addresses automatically
   - Look for BIP32/BIP44/BIP84 compatibility
   - Examples: Electrum, BlueWallet, Ledger, Trezor

3. **Keep Small Amounts Distributed**
   - Don't store all Bitcoin in one address
   - Spread across multiple addresses/wallets
   - Reduces exposure if one address is compromised

4. **Stay Updated**
   - Monitor quantum computing developments
   - Update wallet software regularly
   - Follow Bitcoin security news and updates

### Wallet Recommendations

**Hardware Wallets (Most Secure):**
- Coldcard (Bitcoin-only)
- Trezor Model Safe/T/One
- Blockstream Jade/Jade Plus
- Ledger Nano S/X

**Mobile Wallets (Good Security):**
- BlueWallet
- Electrum Mobile
- Green Wallet (Blockstream)

**Desktop Wallets:**
- Electrum
- Bitcoin Core
- Wasabi (privacy-focused)

All recommended wallets support modern address types and good security practices.

## Understanding Quantum Threats

### Current Status (2024)
- **No immediate threat** - Current quantum computers cannot break Bitcoin cryptography
- **Timeline uncertain** - Experts estimate 10-20+ years before quantum computers pose real risk
- **Bitcoin is preparing** - Developers are researching quantum-resistant upgrades

### Why Bitcoin Mini Checks This
- **Early warning system** - Identifies potential vulnerabilities before they become critical
- **Educational tool** - Helps users understand and improve their security practices
- **Future-proofing** - Encourages adoption of more secure patterns

### What Makes Bitcoin Quantum-Resistant
1. **Hash functions** (SHA-256) are more quantum-resistant than public key cryptography
2. **Unused addresses** only reveal hashes, not public keys
3. **Modern address formats** provide better protection patterns
4. **Network effect** - Bitcoin's scale incentivizes quantum-resistant upgrades

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Should I panic if I have "High Risk" addresses?
**A:** No panic needed, but do take action. Current quantum computers cannot break Bitcoin. This analysis helps you prepare for future threats and improve security now.

### Q: How often should I check my risk status?
**A:** Check after any transaction involving the address. Bitcoin Mini automatically updates when you refresh address data.

### Q: Will Bitcoin upgrade to be quantum-resistant?
**A:** Bitcoin developers are actively researching quantum-resistant cryptography. Any upgrade would be implemented gradually with community consensus.

### Q: Are hardware wallets quantum-resistant?
**A:** Hardware wallets use the same cryptography as software wallets. They're more secure overall but not specifically quantum-resistant. Follow the same address practices.

### Q: Should I move all my Bitcoin to new addresses?
**A:** Focus on "High Risk" addresses first. For others, gradually migrate to SegWit addresses as you make transactions naturally.
