# Privacy Policy for Bitcoin Mini Extension

*Last updated: September 17, 2025*

## Overview
Bitcoin Mini is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension stores all your data locally on your device and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.

## Information We Collect
Bitcoin Mini does NOT collect any personal information. The extension only accesses:

### Local Storage
- **Bitcoin addresses** you manually add to track
- **Address labels** you create
- **PIN codes** (stored locally as hashed values)
- **User preferences** (currency, vault timeout settings)

All this data is stored locally in your browser and never transmitted to external servers.

### Network Requests
The extension makes requests to public APIs for:
- **Bitcoin price data** from CoinGecko API
- **Network fee data** from Mempool.space API
- **Address balance data** from Blockstream.info API

These requests contain only public Bitcoin addresses and no personal identifying information.

## Data Usage
- **Local data** is used solely to provide the extension's functionality
- **API requests** are made only to display current Bitcoin prices, fees, and address balances
- **No analytics** or tracking data is collected
- **No user behavior** is monitored or recorded

## Data Storage
- All user data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API
- **No cloud storage** or external databases are used
- **No data synchronization** across devices
- Data persists until you uninstall the extension or clear browser data

## Data Sharing
Bitcoin Mini does NOT share any data with third parties. We do not:
- Sell or rent any information
- Share data with advertisers

## Security
- **PIN codes** are hashed using SHA-256 before storage
- **Bitcoin addresses** are stored locally and not transmitted unnecessarily
- **No external authentication** or user accounts required
- Extension follows browser security best practices

## Your Rights
You have full control over your data:
- **Export data** using the built-in export feature
- **Delete data** by removing addresses or resetting the extension
- **No account needed** - you own your data completely
